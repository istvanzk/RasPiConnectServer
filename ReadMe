Forked Release
Updated to work with Python3.4+. Main changes compared to the original milocreek/RasPiConnectServer are:
- The web module was replaced by the cherrypy module to provide additional functionalities.
- Updated all python files in config, local, RasPilib and ExecuteFiles to work with Pyhton3.4+. The Adafruit files have not been updated yet.
- The local/LocalExample.py uses a dispatcher class to register handlers for the the different objectServerID.
- The rpiconn.sh script was added to run the RasPiConnectServer as a service via init.d

This is the RasPiConnectServer designed for the RasPiConnect App available on the Apple AppStore

startserver.sh - script to start the server 

(Note: You may wish to change the amixer command in the script.  the command form is:  sudo amixer cset numid=3 <n>.  Substituting <n> for the desired mode: 0=auto, 1=headphones, 2=hdmi. For example, to force the Raspberry Pi to use the analog output:
sudo amixer cset numid=3 1) 

There are four ways of starting the RasPiConnect server:

 
1) Running from the command line:  python RasPiConnectServer.py 
For the RasPiConnectServer to continue working, the terminal window must remain open.

2) Running in the background from the command line:  nohup python RasPiConnectServer.py &
This runs the RasPiConnectServer in the background and the "nohup" means that it will continue running even if you terminate the terminal or log out.  Output from the RasPiConnectServer will be placed in the same directory in a file "nohup.out"

3) Running RasPiConnectServer on startup.

etc/rc.local is a script on the Raspberry Pi which runs when Linux first boots. To edit it, you will need root privileges:

sudo nano /etc/rc.local

and add to the file (before the exit 0 statement):

date >> /var/log/RasPiConnectServer.log
echo "Starting RasPiConnectServer..." >> /var/log/RasPiConnectServer.log
nohup /home/pi/RasPiConnectServer/startserver.sh >>/var/log/RasPiConnectServer.log 2>&1 &

4) Run the RasPiConnectServer as a service via init.d. Use the rpiconn.sh script.
